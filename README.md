 ## Summary
 As part of the summary, we will address one of the drawbacks of this page, and provide two recommendations for how it could be improved in the future.

#### Drawbacks

 - The search filters displays all the results in the same page. This makes the webpage very lengthy.
 - The search filter input boxes are case sensitive, which makes it difficult for the users to search .Ex - city names , state names , country names are all lower case .It would be  an add-on if the page looked for alias of country (us /USA) ,(tomball / Tomball) etc.

#### Recommendations

 - Incorporating a page break options where in first 5 search results are displayed on 1 page , 6-10 on page 2 and so on.
 - Adding drop-down options for available search options for each input box. It was noticed that UFO Sightings data is available only for few city/state/country combinations. If we have drop down options for input box ,user can select from available options.
